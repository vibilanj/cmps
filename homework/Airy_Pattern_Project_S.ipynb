When this diffracted wave hits a screen that is perpendicular to the aperture, the diffraction pattern can be observed.

For a perfect optical telescope with a circular mirror, $A(x, y) = 1$, for $r < R$ and $A = 0$ otherwise, where $R$ is the telescope radius and $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$. The diffraction pattern is then the well-known Airy pattern. -->\n",

    "\n",
    "For this project, we will be analyzing different appertures. A general aperture function will be given by ```Aperture(x, y)```. So, it is useful to start by writing a function that takes ```Aperture(x, y)```, $k$, $D$, the size of the screen hosting the aperture, and number of points on the 2D grid and returns the field on the screen position beyond the aperture. Start by writing ```E_Fields(Aperture, k, D, screen_size, nPts)``` which returns the aperture grid, the aperture signal, the target grid, and the target signal."

Create a pair of 2D plots showing the aperture and the diffracted pattern on the target screen. It is up to you how far you position the screen, but remember that it has to be positioned at a distance that is substantially larger than $\\pi R^2 / \\lambda$, where $R$ is the aperture radius. **Think about reasonable values here!**. Recall that $k = 2\\pi / \\lambda$. **Be careful with the units!!!**\n",
